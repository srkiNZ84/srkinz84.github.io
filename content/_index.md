# About me

Living and working in New Zealand, having moved here in the early 1990's. For money (and sometimes for fun) I like to write
"Infrastructure as Code" as well as work in software engineering teams to ensure that the applications we're producing
are operable (configurable, monitorable, log useful messages, scalable, resilient, upgradable etc...).

In order to do this, I usually try to ensure that we have good feedback loops, specifically:

_Ensure that the CI builds are triggering off of every commit (know Bamboo, GoCD, Jenkins etc...)_

_Ensure we are able to automate the deploy of the full system on every successful build and run integration, end to end tests and potentially load tests_

_Ensure we have a system to automatically apply and deploy security patches, bug fixes in a safe and timely manner_
